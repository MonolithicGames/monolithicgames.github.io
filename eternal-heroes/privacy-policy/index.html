            <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (&#8220;Policy&#8221;). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;) in the &#8220;Eternal Heroes&#8221; application (&#8220;Application&#8221; or &#8220;Service&#8221;) and any of its related products and services (collectively, &#8220;Services&#8221;), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.</p>
            <p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (&#8220;User&#8221;, &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;your&#8221;) and this Application developer (&#8220;Operator&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;).

If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Application and Services. By accessing and using the Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>

            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="automatic-collection-of-information">Automatic collection of information</h2>
            <p>When you use the Application, our servers automatically record information that your device sends. This data may include information such as your device&#8217;s IP address and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in the Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
            <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular User of the system.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="collection-of-personal-information">Collection of personal information</h2>
            <p>You can access and use the Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered in the Application, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).</p>
            <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any forms in the Application. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)</li>
                <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us (such as articles, images, feedback, etc)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features in the Application. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="privacy-of-children">Privacy of children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Application and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child&#8217;s Personal Information from our Services.</p>
            <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&#8217;s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="use-and-processing-of-collected-information">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.</p>
            <p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
            <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
            <p>In order to make the Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
                <li>Run and operate the Application and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our Application and Services.</p>
            <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="disclosure-of-information">Disclosure of information</h2>
            <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, &#8220;Service Providers&#8221;) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Application and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.</p>
            <p>Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes. We will share and disclose your information only with the following categories of Service Providers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication and collaboration services</li>
                <li>Data analytics services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="retention-of-information">Retention of information</h2>
            <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
            <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="data-analytics">Data analytics</h2>
            <p>Our Application and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information. The information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such as how often Users visit our Application and Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained from these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our Application and Services. We do not use third-party analytics tools to track or to collect any personally identifiable information of our Users and we will not associate any information gathered from the statistical reports with any individual User.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="links-to-other-resources">Links to other resources</h2>
            <p>The Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Application and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="information-security">Information security</h2>
            <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="data-breach">Data breach</h2>
            <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Application and Services has been compromised or Users&#8217; Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the Application.</p>
            
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Application and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page, post a notification in the Application. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
            <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Application and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.</p>
           
            <h2 class="titleSmall pt-2" id="acceptance-of-this-policy">Acceptance of this policy</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions.
